## Overview

**Machinery** is a Rust-based framework for continuous individual health monitoring that constructs accurate, personalized health models through iterative system prediction. The core principle is simple yet powerful: **given some parts of an individual's biological system, predict the other parts**. Through continuous iteration and refinement, Machinery builds comprehensive health models that understand the unique patterns and relationships within each person's physiology.

Unlike traditional health monitoring systems that rely on population averages or static thresholds, Machinery recognizes that biological measurements are inherently contextual. An 81 bpm heart rate means vastly different things depending on the individual's baseline, current activity, stress levels, sleep quality, metabolic state, and countless other factors. Machinery captures and models these complex, interdependent relationships.

## Core Philosophy

### The Contextual Nature of Health Data

Traditional health systems treat measurements as absolute values:
- "Normal" heart rate: 60-100 bpm
- "Healthy" blood glucose: 70-99 mg/dL  
- "Optimal" sleep: 7-9 hours

**Machinery recognizes that health is fundamentally contextual:**
- 81 bpm at rest after 8 hours of sleep vs. 81 bpm after climbing stairs
- 85 mg/dL glucose fasting vs. 85 mg/dL two hours post-meal
- 6 hours of deep, restorative sleep vs. 8 hours of fragmented sleep

### Iterative System Prediction

Machinery operates on the principle that biological systems are predictable networks of relationships. By continuously observing patterns and testing predictions, the system builds increasingly accurate models of how each individual's biology functions:

1. **Observe**: Collect continuous data streams from multiple biological systems
2. **Predict**: Use current system state to predict other system components
3. **Validate**: Compare predictions against actual measurements
4. **Learn**: Refine models based on prediction accuracy
5. **Iterate**: Continuously improve understanding of the individual system

### Seke Scripts: Hybrid Logical-Fuzzy Programming

The heart of Machinery's flexibility lies in **Seke scripts** - a domain-specific language that combines logical programming with fuzzy logic systems. Seke scripts allow the system to handle the inherent uncertainty and context-dependency of biological measurements.

#### Example Seke Script: Heart Rate Context Analysis

```seke
// Heart rate interpretation with contextual fuzzy logic
rule heart_rate_analysis {
    input: hr_current, hr_baseline, activity_level, sleep_quality, stress_markers
    
    // Fuzzy sets for heart rate deviation
    fuzzy hr_deviation = (hr_current - hr_baseline) / hr_baseline
    
    context resting_state {
        if activity_level < 0.2 and time_since_activity > 10min {
            if hr_deviation in [-0.1, 0.1] -> "normal_resting"
            if hr_deviation in [0.1, 0.3] -> "elevated_resting" 
            if hr_deviation > 0.3 -> "concerning_elevation"
        }
    }
    
    context post_exercise {
        if time_since_activity < 30min {
            expected_recovery = calculate_recovery_curve(exercise_intensity, fitness_level)
            if hr_current within expected_recovery -> "normal_recovery"
            else -> "abnormal_recovery"
        }
    }
    
    // Logical rules with fuzzy confidence
    predict cardiovascular_stress {
        confidence = 0.8 if (hr_deviation > 0.2 and stress_markers.elevated)
        confidence = 0.6 if (hr_deviation > 0.15 and sleep_quality < 0.7)
        confidence = 0.9 if (hr_deviation > 0.3 and activity_level < 0.1)
    }
}
```

#### Example Seke Script: Metabolic State Prediction

```seke
// Predict glucose response based on multiple system inputs
rule glucose_prediction {
    input: current_glucose, meal_composition, exercise_history, sleep_debt, stress_level
    
    // Fuzzy modeling of insulin sensitivity
    fuzzy insulin_sensitivity {
        base_sensitivity = individual_baseline.insulin_sensitivity
        
        // Sleep impact on sensitivity
        sleep_modifier = if sleep_debt < 1hr -> 1.0
                        if sleep_debt in [1hr, 3hr] -> 0.85
                        if sleep_debt > 3hr -> 0.7
        
        // Exercise impact (time-dependent)
        exercise_modifier = calculate_exercise_sensitivity_boost(
            time_since_exercise, exercise_intensity, exercise_duration
        )
        
        current_sensitivity = base_sensitivity * sleep_modifier * exercise_modifier
    }
    
    // Predict glucose response to meal
    predict postprandial_glucose {
        carb_load = meal_composition.carbohydrates
        expected_peak = current_glucose + (carb_load / current_sensitivity)
        expected_time_to_peak = 45min + (stress_level * 15min)
        
        confidence = 0.9 if meal_composition.complete
        confidence = 0.7 if meal_composition.estimated
    }
    
    // Predict when glucose will return to baseline
    predict glucose_clearance {
        clearance_rate = current_sensitivity * 0.8
        time_to_baseline = (expected_peak - individual_baseline.glucose) / clearance_rate
    }
}
```

### Continuous Data Collection

Machinery integrates with multiple data sources to build comprehensive individual models:

#### Physiological Streams
- **Cardiovascular**: Heart rate, HRV, blood pressure, pulse wave velocity
- **Metabolic**: Continuous glucose monitoring, ketones, lactate
- **Respiratory**: Breathing rate, oxygen saturation, CO2 levels
- **Neurological**: EEG patterns, reaction times, cognitive performance
- **Hormonal**: Cortisol, melatonin, insulin, thyroid markers

#### Behavioral Streams  
- **Activity**: Movement patterns, exercise intensity, sedentary time
- **Sleep**: Sleep stages, duration, efficiency, timing
- **Nutrition**: Meal timing, macronutrient composition, hydration
- **Environmental**: Temperature, humidity, air quality, light exposure

#### Genomic and Metabolomic Integration
- **Genetic Variants**: SNPs affecting drug metabolism, nutrient processing, disease risk
- **Metabolomic Profiles**: Real-time metabolite concentrations, pathway activity
- **Epigenetic Markers**: Dynamic gene expression changes based on lifestyle

### Iterative Prediction Engine

The core of Machinery's learning system continuously tests and refines its understanding:

```rust
// Simplified representation of the prediction cycle
pub struct PredictionCycle {
    current_state: SystemState,
    prediction_models: Vec<PredictionModel>,
    validation_metrics: ValidationFramework,
}

impl PredictionCycle {
    pub async fn iterate(&mut self) -> PredictionResult {
        // 1. Generate predictions based on current system state
        let predictions = self.generate_predictions().await;
        
        // 2. Wait for actual measurements
        let actual_measurements = self.collect_measurements().await;
        
        // 3. Validate predictions against reality
        let validation_results = self.validate_predictions(
            &predictions, 
            &actual_measurements
        ).await;
        
        // 4. Update models based on accuracy
        self.update_models(&validation_results).await;
        
        // 5. Refine understanding of individual patterns
        self.refine_individual_patterns().await;
        
        validation_results
    }
}
```

### Context-Aware Modeling

Machinery's models understand that the same measurement can have different meanings in different contexts:

#### Temporal Context
- **Circadian Rhythms**: How measurements vary throughout the day
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Long-term cyclical changes
- **Menstrual Cycles**: Hormonal fluctuations affecting all systems
- **Training Cycles**: Adaptation and recovery patterns

#### Situational Context
- **Stress States**: How acute and chronic stress affect all measurements
- **Illness Recovery**: How the immune response changes normal patterns
- **Medication Effects**: How pharmaceuticals alter system relationships
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, altitude, air quality impacts

#### Individual Context
- **Genetic Background**: How genetic variants affect normal ranges
- **Fitness Level**: How conditioning changes physiological responses
- **Age and Development**: How patterns change over time
- **Personal History**: How past events influence current patterns

## Key Features

### 1. Personalized Normal Ranges

Instead of population-based "normal" values, Machinery establishes individual baselines:

```seke
// Individual baseline establishment
rule establish_baseline {
    input: measurement_history, context_data, validation_period
    
    // Calculate personal normal range with confidence intervals
    personal_baseline = calculate_individual_baseline(
        measurements = measurement_history.filter(context == "resting"),
        confidence_level = 0.95,
        minimum_samples = 100
    )
    
    // Account for natural variation
    normal_range = personal_baseline ± (2 * individual_standard_deviation)
    
    // Context-specific adjustments
    adjust_for_context(time_of_day, activity_level, stress_state)
}
```

### 2. Predictive Health Modeling

Machinery doesn't just monitor - it predicts:

- **Short-term predictions**: How will glucose respond to this meal?
- **Medium-term predictions**: How will sleep quality affect tomorrow's performance?
- **Long-term predictions**: How will this training program affect fitness markers?

### 3. Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection

The system learns individual patterns and identifies deviations:

```seke
// Anomaly detection with contextual awareness
rule detect_anomalies {
    input: current_measurements, historical_patterns, context
    
    // Calculate expected values based on context
    expected_values = predict_from_context(context, historical_patterns)
    
    // Fuzzy anomaly scoring
    fuzzy anomaly_score {
        deviation = abs(current_measurements - expected_values)
        normalized_deviation = deviation / historical_variance
        
        if normalized_deviation < 1.0 -> "normal"
        if normalized_deviation in [1.0, 2.0] -> "mild_anomaly"
        if normalized_deviation in [2.0, 3.0] -> "moderate_anomaly"
        if normalized_deviation > 3.0 -> "significant_anomaly"
    }
    
    // Context-aware confidence adjustment
    confidence = base_confidence * context_reliability * data_quality
}
```

### 4. Multi-System Integration

Machinery understands that biological systems are interconnected:

- **Cardiovascular-Metabolic**: How heart rate variability relates to glucose control
- **Sleep-Immune**: How sleep quality affects inflammatory markers
- **Stress-Digestive**: How cortisol levels impact gut health
- **Exercise-Recovery**: How training load affects all other systems

### 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation

The system continuously improves its understanding:

- **Model Refinement**: Prediction accuracy improves over time
- **Pattern Discovery**: New relationships are automatically identified
- **Context Learning**: Understanding of situational factors deepens
- **Individual Adaptation**: Models become increasingly personalized
