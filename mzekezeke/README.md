## Core Components

### HealthDataProcessor
Central engine for processing and analyzing health data:

```python
from mzekezeke import HealthDataProcessor

processor = HealthDataProcessor()

# Process real-time health data
health_data = processor.process_stream(raw_sensor_data)

# Generate predictions
predictions = processor.predict_health_state(
    current_metrics=health_data,
    time_horizon=24  # hours
)
```

### HeartRateAnalyzer
Specialized cardiovascular analysis:

```python
from mzekezeke.health_metrics import HeartRateAnalyzer

hr_analyzer = HeartRateAnalyzer()

# Analyze HRV patterns
hrv_analysis = hr_analyzer.analyze_hrv(
    rr_intervals=heart_rate_data,
    analysis_window=300  # seconds
)

# Get personalized heart rate zones
hr_zones = hr_analyzer.calculate_hr_zones(
    resting_hr=65,
    max_hr=185,
    fitness_level=0.7
)
```

### ML Prediction Pipeline
HuggingFace-powered health predictions:

```python
from mzekezeke.ml_models import HuggingFacePredictor

predictor = HuggingFacePredictor(
    model_name="health-forecasting-v1"
)

# Predict glucose response to meal
glucose_prediction = predictor.predict_glucose_response(
    current_glucose=95,
    meal_composition={"carbs": 45, "protein": 20, "fat": 15},
    context={"time_of_day": "morning", "exercise_recent": False}
)
```

## Installation

```bash
cd mzekezeke
pip install -e .

# For development
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# For advanced ML features
pip install -e ".[advanced]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
from mzekezeke import HealthDataProcessor, HeartRateAnalyzer

# Initialize the system
processor = HealthDataProcessor()
hr_analyzer = HeartRateAnalyzer()

# Simulate some heart rate data
heart_rate_data = np.random.normal(70, 10, 1000)  # 1000 heart rate samples

# Analyze the data
analysis_result = processor.analyze_health_metrics({
    "heart_rate": heart_rate_data,
    "timestamp": np.arange(1000)
})

# Get HRV analysis
hrv_result = hr_analyzer.analyze_hrv_comprehensive(heart_rate_data)

print(f"Health Score: {analysis_result.overall_score:.2f}")
print(f"HRV RMSSD: {hrv_result.rmssd:.2f} ms")
print(f"Stress Level: {hrv_result.stress_index:.2f}")
```
