**Continuous Individual Health Modeling Through Iterative System Prediction**

Machinery is a Rust-based framework for contextual health interpretation and iterative system prediction, inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophy and systems biology principles.

## What is Machinery?

Machinery represents a paradigm shift from static health assessments to dynamic, contextual health modeling. Rather than treating symptoms in isolation, Machinery views health as an emergent property of complex biological systems operating within specific environmental and temporal contexts.

## Core Principles

- **Contextual Health Interpretation**: Health outcomes are understood within the context of individual biology, environment, and temporal patterns
- **Temporal Data Validity**: Recognition that all health data has time-bound validity and degrades with contextual distance
- **Iterative System Prediction**: Continuous refinement of health models through feedback loops and adaptive learning
- **Dynamic Medium Awareness**: Accounting for the fact that biological systems change while being measured
- **Holistic Integration**: Integration of multiple data streams including genomics, metabolomics, lifestyle, and environmental factors
- **Fuzzy Logic Processing**: Handling uncertainty and partial truth in biological systems
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment of models based on continuous data input

## Current Implementation Status

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment and begin contributing to Machinery:

1. See [Prerequisites](setup/prerequisites.md) for required tools
2. Follow the [Installation](setup/installation.md) guide
3. Review the [Docker Environment](setup/docker.md) setup
4. Understand the [Development Workflow](setup/workflow.md)

## Architecture

Machinery is designed as a modular system with several key components:

- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination and workflow management
- **SEKE Engine**: Prediction and modeling core
- **Data Collectors**: Multi-source data ingestion
- **Prediction Module**: Machine learning and statistical modeling
- **Validation Module**: Model validation and accuracy assessment
- **Pattern Recognition**: Complex pattern identification in health data
